# GravshipCrashes
This mod takes Gravships found in my other mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3576790938]Gravship Exporter[/url] and randomly adds POIs to the map where a crashing ship may be found.
The gravship will be without GravEngine (why do you think it crashed !) and may be significantly damaged, or hardly damaged at all, there may also be survivors, who wont take kindly to you coming to strip their ship for parts, or them for kidneys...

## Features
* POIs generated randomly containing a crashed Gravship for you to plunder/loot

## Mod Compatibility
In theory it should be compatible with everything, if you're using an exported mod from someone else then you will need any mods they decided to include on the ship otherwise the thing won't spawn and might throw an error.

## Known Issues
* None yet !

# The Point Of This Mod
You can blame [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/comments/1nt3cdt/comment/ngt5oom/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button]Happy_Little_Fish for this comment on Reddit[/url] and my desire to force X-Com into any and all conversations

# Future Plans
* Landed ships with fully alive crew to fight back for a greater challenge

# Source Code
As always all my source code available for anyone else to use, copy, learn from, whatever
